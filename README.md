# Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm [David Grudl](https://davidgrudl.com).

**I invent software that runs a lot of websites you use everyday. I am speaker, trainer and writer.**

I am a software developer (PHP since 1999) and publicist.
I created popular open source project [Nette Framework](https://nette.org/),
database layer [dibi](https://dibiphp.com/),
human friendy markup to XHTML converter [Texy!](https://texy.info/) and many others.
I started programming in the DOS era, now I am focused solely on web-based applications in PHP.
And when I do not program, I write blogs, train web application development, or run Spartan Race.
